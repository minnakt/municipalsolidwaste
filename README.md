# municipalsolidwaste
This is the GitHub repository for our APMA1660 Final Project based on [Forecast Generation Model of Municipal Solid Waste using Multiple Linear Regression (2020)](https://www.gjesm.net/article_36862_3e3b953800d1617d039d3a3dc4d1d447.pdf). Using social and demographic data collected from the municipalities of the Cuenca del  Cañón del Sumidero in Chiapas, Mexico, this paper proposes two multiple linear regression based forecast models that can be used to predict the generation of municipal solid waste.
